Project Description:
Developer Panel Showcase for Android Applications

This Android project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of implementing a developer panel in an Android application, specifically designed to be accessible only in debug builds. The developer panel provides essential tools and features for developers during the application development phase.

Summary:
Build-Type Based Accessibility: The developer panel is accessible only in debug builds, ensuring that it doesn't interfere with the release version of your application.

Multiple Access Points:

Notification Access: Access the developer panel through a prominent notification, providing quick access to essential tools.

Floating Icon: A draggable floating icon allows developers to access the panel from anywhere in the application by dragging it to different positions on the screen.

Drawer on Main Screen: Integrate a modal drawer directly on the main screen for easy access to developer tools without leaving the current context.

Separate Launcher Application: Demonstrate the use of a separate launcher application to access the developer panel, showcasing an alternative method for convenience.

Gradle Configuration: Leverage Gradle build configurations to conditionally include or exclude the developer panel based on the build type.

Dependency Injection (DI): Showcase best practices for dependency injection to maintain a clean and modular codebase.

Comprehensive Example: This repository provides a fully functional example, demonstrating the integration of the developer panel using a variety of access points, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of the implementation.

Explore the codebase, follow the step-by-step guide, and leverage the provided examples to enhance your Android application development workflow with a developer panel tailored for debugging and testing purposes.
